### Hello ğŸ‘‹

I started as a student technology blogger, and more than eight years later I haven't stopping exploring the digital realm since! I'm passionate about investigating IT industries and trends. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently volunteering with the Crisis Text Line and Hire Heroes USA organizations.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the news and tools related to today's cybersecurity threats.

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the last podcast I listened to, and tell me about your favorite!

- âš¡ Fun fact: When not working in cyberspace, I am on the rock wall or my mountain bike chasing adrenaline.
